# Examples
Example projects showing how to generate code from state machines using the Sinelabore code generator. 

SinelaboreRT was built especially for embedded software developers. It focuses on just one task: Generation of readable and maintainable code from hierarchical UML state machines and from activity diagrams. With its unique features the tool covers well the requirements of embedded real-time and low power application developers.

Examples:
- EnergiaBlink: Realzing a blinker using a state machine. Showing how to trace the event flow using Mscgen (http://www.sinelabore.com/doku.php?id=wiki:toolbox:trace-the-event-flow)
- Vending Machine: Example for a more complex example of using state machines.
